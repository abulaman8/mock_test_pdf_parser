Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between emotional intelligence 
and leadership effectiveness?
Options :
6406531738936. 
  Emotional intelligence is not necessarily a predictor of leadership 
effectiveness, as there are other factors such as experience, expertise, and personality that can 
also play a role in effective leadership.
6406531738937. 
  Emotional intelligence may be negatively related to leadership effectiveness, 
as highly emotionally intelligent leaders may be perceived as too soft or empathetic, leading to a 
lack of authority and respect from their followers.
6406531738938. 
   Emotional intelligence is positively related to leadership effectiveness, as it 
allows leaders to understand and manage their own emotions, as well as the emotions of their 
followers, leading to improved communication, motivation, and overall performance.
6406531738939. 
  Emotional intelligence has a curvilinear relationship with leadership 
effectiveness, where moderate levels of emotional intelligence are associated with the highest 
levels of leadership effectiveness. In contrast, both low and high levels of emotional intelligence 
are associated with lower levels of effectiveness.

SEARCH   
The figure shows a map with several locations on a grid where each tile is 1x1 in size. The locations 
are at grid points and are connected by two way edges (roads), where each edge has a cost that is 
the same in both directions. Observe that the edge costs are not necessarily proportional to the 
coordinate based distance estimates.  
 
The start node is S and the goal node is G, the MoveGen function returns neighbours in 
alphabetical order. Use Manhattan distance as the heuristic function.  
 
Tie-breaker: when several nodes have the same best cost, use alphabetical order to break ties.

AUTOMATED PLANNING  
 
The domain description of a blocks-world with a single one-armed robot is provided below.  
Note: this is the same domain description used in the weekly assignments.  
  
 
Tie-breaker for subgoal ordering:  treat the start state, goal description, preconditions and 
effects as lists that are accessed from left to right.  
When the elements in a list are pushed one by one into a stack, the last element will be at the top 
of the stack. It has the effect of reversing the list.  
 
Tie-breaker for block placement:  when there are multiple locations for placing a block, choose the location that satisfies a goal at hand, or else, choose a location that will lead to a plan, or else, 
place it on the table.  
 
Tie-breaker for action selection:  when actions are chosen non-deterministically, choose actions 
that lead to a plan, even a suboptimal plan is fine. Throwaway the actions that may lead to loops.  
 
A planning problem is given below, find a plan using the operators and predicates defined in the 
blocks-world domain.  
 
 
 
Based on the above data, answer the given subquestions.

You enter an alien world as a renowned computational biologist. The below table is presented to 
you as a part of a preliminary study done by a group of scientists to study the local fauna around 
the base camp. They analyze the DNA and figure out that there are only two bases “+” and “0”. The 
below table represents the DNA sequence in 6 positions for the different species found. You build 
a phylogenetic tree that best represents the evolutionary relationship among the species, using 
the Neighbor-Joining algorithm (on the Hamming distance matrix).

Which of the following is/are false about UPGMA?
Options :
6406531739317. 
  UPGMA is a simple clustering heuristic that proceeds via iterative pairwise grouping in each step.
6406531739318. 
  Given a distance matrix, it starts by grouping two taxa with the largest 
pairwise distance in the distance matrix.
6406531739319. 
  The distances between this new composite taxon and all remaining taxa are 
calculated to create a reduced matrix.
6406531739320. 
  The grouping process is repeated and another newly reduced matrix is 
created.

Consider the below mutually-exclusive characterisations about the program:  
i. Program will not run since RDD transformation operation map() runs on Executors that is 
referencing a variable train_master which is declared in the Spark driver  
ii. Program will run successfully and produce the count of bookings that match for trains present 
in the train_master  
 
For either of the 2 characterizations, consider the following (one or more) actions you could carry 
out in order to improve on the characterizations:  
1. Program will need to be changed to bring the train_master into the Closure for executors to pick 
it up  
2. Program will perform more poorly as the number of executors per worker node increases. 
Broadcast of train_master will need to be used to make it perform better.  
3. Program will perform more poorly as the number of worker nodes increases (keeping number 
of executors per worker node constant). Broadcast of train_master will need to be used to make it 
perform better.

your voice directions while driving a car. Which prototype would you build for this purpose?
Options :
6406531739890. 
  Have pre-determined turn-by-turn directions for a particular route written on a 
notepad. The experimenter reads the right directions while the participant drives on the route.
6406531739891. 
  Create a fully functional system with a database of routes, directions and voice 
clips on a laptop and put the laptop in the car. The participant drives the car along the route and 
hears the turn directions from the laptop.
6406531739892. 
  A paper prototype of the GPS display with multiple screens that each shows 
the map at a different part of a route. The participant evaluates the prototype in a lab. For each 
screen, the experimenter speaks out the turn directions and asks the participant what he should 
do (e.g., “I’d take the next exit”).
6406531739893. 
  Create a video of a person driving on a route, and then add your instructions 
as a voiceover. Show participants this video, pause the video after each instruction and ask what 
participants would do.

User Experience of a Grocery Store   
A team of IITM BS DTD-DAD students conducted in-depth interviews and observations with 
shoppers in the Prime Mart, a grocery store located on the IIT Madras campus, to understand 
their pain points and needs. They identified common issues such as long checkout lines, difficulty 
finding products, and confusion about pricing. The team analyzed the research findings and 
synthesized the information into clear problem statements. They identified the key issue as 
improving the checkout experience to reduce wait times and increase customer satisfaction. The 
team generated a variety of potential solutions through brainstorming sessions and creative 
exercises. They came up with ideas such as self-checkout kiosks, mobile payment options, and 
optimizing the layout of the store. The team created rough drafts of their ideas to test with users. 
They developed a mobile payment app prototype app that allowed customers to scan and pay for 
items as they shopped. However, they encountered some issues during the prototyping phase, 
such as technical glitches and difficulty integrating the app with the store’s existing systems. The 
team tested their prototype with real users to gather feedback and identify areas for 
improvement. They found that the app was well-received by users and helped to reduce checkout 
times, but there were still some issues that needed to be addressed before implementation.
